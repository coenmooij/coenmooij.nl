    <p>
      Everything is dual
      <br>
      everything has poles
      <br>
      everything has its pair of opposites
      <br>
      like and unlike are the same
      <br>
      opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree
      <br>
      extremes meet
      <br>
      all truths are but half-truths
      <br>
      all paradoxes may be reconciled
